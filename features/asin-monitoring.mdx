## How ASIN Monitoring Works

</Frame>

Alertix uses a sophisticated monitoring system to track changes to your Amazon product listings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Collection">
    Our system regularly scans your product listings on Amazon to collect current data about titles, images, features, pricing, Buy Box status, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change Detection">
    The collected data is compared against previous versions to identify any changes that have occurred since the last scan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Alert Generation">
    When changes are detected that match your alert preferences, notifications are generated and delivered through your chosen channels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Historical Tracking">
    All changes are recorded in our system, allowing you to view historical data and trends over time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Alertix scans your listings multiple times per day, with frequency varying by subscription plan. Business and Enterprise plans include more frequent monitoring.
</Info>

## Monitoring Frequency

| Plan | Standard Scan Frequency | Priority ASIN Scan Frequency* |
|------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Basic | 4 times daily | N/A |
| Professional | 6 times daily | 12 times daily |
| Business | 8 times daily | 24 times daily |
| Enterprise | 12 times daily | Hourly |

*Priority ASIN monitoring is available on Professional plans and above for a limited number of your most important products.

<Tip>
  Designate your best-selling or most competitive products as Priority ASINs to receive more frequent monitoring and faster alerts.

  <Step title="Set Priority ASINs">
