  <Accordion title="Assign Team Responsibilities">
    For Business and Enterprise users, route different types of alerts to specific team members based on their roles and responsibilities.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Quiet Hours Strategically">
    Configure quiet hours for non-critical notifications during your off-hours, while ensuring truly urgent alerts can still come through.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Regular Notification Audit">
    Periodically review your notification settings to ensure you're not experiencing alert fatigue or missing important updates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
