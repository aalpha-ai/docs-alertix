# API Authentication

The Alertix API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Alertix Dashboard.

## Getting Started

To use the Alertix API, you'll need to:

1. Generate an API key in your Alertix dashboard
2. Include the API key in your requests
3. Follow our rate limiting guidelines

<Note>
  API access is available on Professional plans and above. Enterprise customers receive higher rate limits and additional endpoints.
</Note>

## Generating an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access API Settings">
    Navigate to Account Settings â†’ API Access in your Alertix dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New API Key">
    Click the "Generate New API Key" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Permissions">
    Select the appropriate access level for your API key:
    - Read Only: Can only retrieve data
    - Standard: Can read data and create/update certain resources
    - Admin: Full API access (available only on Business and Enterprise plans)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Key">
    Give your API key a descriptive name to identify its purpose.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Your Key">
    Copy and securely store your API key. For security reasons, we only show it once.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Treat your API keys like passwords. Don't share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or in your application's source code.
</Warning>

## Authentication Methods

### Bearer Token Authentication

The preferred way to authenticate with the Alertix API is using Bearer token authentication:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.alertix.com/v1/asins" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Query Parameter Authentication

For GET requests only, you can also authenticate by including your API key as a query parameter:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.alertix.com/v1/asins?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Warning>
  Query parameter authentication should only be used for testing or in environments where setting headers isn't possible. Bearer token authentication is more secure.
</Warning>

## API Key Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rotating API Keys">
    We recommend rotating your API keys periodically for security:
    
    1. Generate a new API key
    2. Update your applications to use the new key
    3. Verify everything works correctly
    4. Delete the old API key
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Revoking API Keys">
    If an API key is compromised:
    
    1. Immediately delete the compromised key in your dashboard
    2. Generate a new key with appropriate permissions
    3. Update your applications with the new key
    4. Monitor your account for any unauthorized activity
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Key Permissions">
    Limit API key permissions to only what's necessary:
    
    - Read-only keys for reporting applications
    - Standard keys for operational tools
    - Admin keys only when absolutely necessary
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limiting

To ensure stability and availability for all users, the Alertix API implements rate limiting:

| Plan | Rate Limit | Burst Capacity |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Professional | 60 requests/minute | 100 requests |
| Business | 300 requests/minute | 500 requests |
| Enterprise | 1,000+ requests/minute | Custom |

### Rate Limit Headers

All API responses include headers to help you track your rate limit usage:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 56
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1499356800
```

<Tip>
  Implement exponential backoff in your API clients to handle rate limiting gracefully. When you receive a 429 response, wait before retrying.
</Tip>

## Error Handling

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure:

- `2xx` range indicates success
- `4xx` range indicates an error with the provided information
- `5xx` range indicates an error with Alertix's servers

### Common Authentication Errors

| Status Code | Error Code | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 401 | `unauthorized` | No valid API key provided |
| 403 | `forbidden` | API key doesn't have permission |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | Rate limit exceeded |

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "Invalid API key provided",
    "documentation_url": "https://docs.alertix.com/api-reference/authentication#errors"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Secure Storage" icon="lock">
    Store API keys securely using environment variables or a secure key management service, never in source code.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Least Privilege" icon="shield-check">
    Use the minimum permissions necessary for each API key based on its intended use.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Implement Retry Logic" icon="redo">
    Add proper retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling rate limits and transient errors.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Monitor Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Regularly review API usage in your dashboard to detect unusual patterns that might indicate security issues.
