During onboarding, you'll select which types of alerts you want to receive for your Amazon listings.

### Preference Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Listing Status Changes">
    Get notified when listings are suppressed, deleted, or become inactive. This alerts you when Amazon removes listings from search results or catalog due to policy violations, content issues, or other compliance problems.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Buy Box Status Changes">
    Receive notifications when you lose or win the Buy Box. Critical for sales performance as the Buy Box drives 80%+ of Amazon sales; alerts when competitors take over the Buy Box or when you regain it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Title Change">
    Get alerts when your listing's title changes. Detects unauthorized modifications to product titles which could affect search ranking, customer expectations, or brand representation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Feature Change">
    Receive alerts when your listing's features change. Monitors changes to bullet points and product specifications that could misrepresent the product or affect search visibility.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Main Image">
    Get alerts when your listing's images change. Detects changes to the primary product image which heavily influences click-through rates and conversion; prevents unauthorized image replacements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Out of Stock Alerts">
    Receive out of stocks alerts for your listings. Notifies when inventory levels reach zero, helping prevent lost sales and search ranking penalties from stockouts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review Count Changes">
    Get notifications for new Amazon reviews and seller feedback. Alerts about new customer reviews and seller feedback, enabling quick responses to negative reviews and monitoring of product reception.
  </Accordion>

    Get notified when the number of offers on your listing changes. Tracks competitive landscape changes when new sellers list the same product or existing sellers drop out.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Adult Flagging">
    Get notified if your listing is flagged as adult content. Alerts when Amazon classifies products as adult content, which restricts visibility and advertising options.
  </Accordion>
