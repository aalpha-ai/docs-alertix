## Security Measures

Alertix implements several security measures to protect your account:

- **Secure Authentication**: We use Clerk, a trusted authentication provider, to handle all login processes securely.
- **Email Verification**: All new accounts require email verification to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Password Protection**: Passwords are securely hashed and never stored in plain text.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Optional 2FA for an additional layer of security.
- **Session Management**: Automatic session timeouts and the ability to view and manage active sessions.

<Info>
  For additional security, we recommend enabling two-factor authentication in your account settings after registration.
