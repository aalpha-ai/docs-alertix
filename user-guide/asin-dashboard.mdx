### ASIN Status Indicators

Each ASIN in your dashboard displays important status information at a glance:

| Status      | Indicator      | Description                                     |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Active      | Green Badge    | ASIN is currently being monitored and validated |
| Inactive    | Gray Badge     | ASIN is paused or not currently being monitored |
| New Alerts  | Red Counter    | Number of unread alerts for this ASIN           |
| In Progress | Yellow Counter | Number of alerts marked as in progress          |
