Alertix allows you to customize exactly which types of alerts you want to receive for your Amazon listings. This ensures you're only notified about the changes that matter most to your business.

## General Alert Preferences

The Alert Preferences section lets you configure global settings that apply to all your monitored ASINs by default.

### Available Alert Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Listing Status Changes">
    Get notified when listings are suppressed, deleted, or become inactive. This alerts you when Amazon removes listings from search results or catalog due to policy violations, content issues, or other compliance problems.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Buy Box Status Changes">
    Receive notifications when you lose or win the Buy Box. Critical for sales performance as the Buy Box drives 80%+ of Amazon sales; alerts when competitors take over the Buy Box or when you regain it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Title Change">
    Get alerts when your listing's title changes. Detects unauthorized modifications to product titles which could affect search ranking, customer expectations, or brand representation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Feature Change">
    Receive alerts when your listing's features change. Monitors changes to bullet points and product specifications that could misrepresent the product or affect search visibility.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Main Image">
    Get alerts when your listing's images change. Detects changes to the primary product image which heavily influences click-through rates and conversion; prevents unauthorized image replacements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Out of Stock Alerts">
    Receive out of stocks alerts for your listings. Notifies when inventory levels reach zero, helping prevent lost sales and search ranking penalties from stockouts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review Count Changes">
    Get notifications for new Amazon reviews and seller feedback. Alerts about new customer reviews and seller feedback, enabling quick responses to negative reviews and monitoring of product reception.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Number of Offers">
    Get notified when the number of offers on your listing changes. Tracks competitive landscape changes when new sellers list the same product or existing sellers drop out.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Adult Flagging">
    Get notified if your listing is flagged as adult content. Alerts when Amazon classifies products as adult content, which restricts visibility and advertising options.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Configuration Tips

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Best Practices">
    - **Start with all alerts enabled** to understand what changes are occurring
    - **Gradually refine** by disabling less relevant alerts based on your experience
    - **Focus on high-impact alerts** like Buy Box changes and listing suppressions
    - **Consider your product category** when choosing which alerts matter most
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Notification Management">
    - **Email notifications** are sent for all enabled alert types
    - **In-app notifications** appear in your dashboard
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  All alert preferences are enabled by default for maximum monitoring coverage. You can disable any alert types that aren't relevant to your business.
</Tip>

## ASIN-Specific Alert Preferences

For more granular control, Alertix allows you to configure alert preferences for individual ASINs, overriding your global settings.

### Accessing ASIN-Specific Preferences

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to ASINs">
    Go to the Monitored ASINs dashboard from the main navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Product">
    Click "View Details" on the specific product you want to configure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Preferences">
    Toggle individual alert types on or off for this specific ASIN.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Changes are saved automatically as you toggle each preference.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Product Information Display

When configuring ASIN-specific preferences, you'll see detailed product information:

- Product image thumbnail
- ASIN code
- Full product title
- Product description (if available)

<Warning>
  ASIN-specific preferences override global settings. If you disable an alert type globally but enable it for a specific ASIN, you'll still receive alerts for that product.
</Warning>
