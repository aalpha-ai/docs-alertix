|----------|-------|-------------|
| Critical | Red | Urgent issues requiring immediate attention (e.g., listing suppression, Buy Box loss) |
| High | Orange | Important changes that may impact sales (e.g., title changes, main image changes) |
| Medium | Yellow | Notable changes worth reviewing (e.g., feature changes, new reviews) |
