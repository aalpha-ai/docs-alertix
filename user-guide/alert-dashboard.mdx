|----------|-------|-------------|
| Critical | Red | Urgent issues requiring immediate attention (e.g., listing suppression, Buy Box loss) |
| High | Orange | Important changes that may impact sales (e.g., title changes, main image changes) |
| Medium | Yellow | Notable changes worth reviewing (e.g., feature changes, new reviews) |
| Low | Blue | Informational updates (e.g., minor price fluctuations) |

  You can customize which priority levels trigger email notifications in your Alert Preferences settings.
